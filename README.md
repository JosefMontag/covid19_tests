## International Data on COVID-19 Testing Volume (by date and country)

### About this data

Testing data is critical to our understanding of dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses of individual governments and their efficacy. "**Test! Test! Test!**" is WHO's core prescription.

This is a **public repository for international data on COVID-19 testing volumes** with the goal to provide analysis-ready data for  analyses of the pandemic and testing policies. 

This data is being continuously collated by community effort. However, **volunteers are still needed** to make the data as comprehensive as possible and keep it up to date. You may **join the efforts by contributing data from your country at http://bit.ly/covid-tests-data**.

Using that link, you may also provide feedback or corrections. You may contact us directly at josef.montag@gmail.com.

### Updates and merging with other datasets

We will be posting snapshots of this data in the long (panel) form. Each country-day observation is identified using standard ISO 3166 country codes and the data can thus be easily merged with other relevant cross-country datasets.
